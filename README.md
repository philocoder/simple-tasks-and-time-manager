<h1>Simple Tasks and Time Manager</h1>

<h3>A new, minimalist, simple and fashion way of managing your time and set up your own timetable</h3>

<h6>It will be easy, fast, and unpainfull, just give it a chance</h6>

<p>
This is a functional (and random) example of how to use this application:
<pre><b>28/2/2017

10:00-11:00 => Have the deal with that guy.
21:00-21:15 => Meet that girl at the restaurant.

1/3/2017

6:45-7:00 => Pick some trumpets.</b></pre>
</p>

I won't make you lose your time. Instead, I want you to save it. So, let's explain how it works.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download the "index.html" file.</li>
  <li>Open it with your favourite browser.</li>
  <li>Ready.</li>
  <li>Once there, you have an example, you can follow it, or follow this instructions.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Now that you are ready, you just need to know what to type in the text box.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Day: 
    <br/>
    <b>{day}/{month}/{year}</b>
    <br/>
    For example: 
      <ul>
        <li>1/1/1990</li>
        <li>30/12/2000</li>
        <li>30/6/2001</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Jump line</li>
  <li>Hour to start, hour to end, and task name: 
    <br/>
    <b>{hour to start}-{hour to end} => {task}</b>
    <br/>
    For example: 
      <ul>
        <li>00:00-23:59 => A task for all the day.</li>
        <li>16:00-17:00 => Have a "buena siesta".</li>
        <li>14:00-15:00 => Watch the Simpsons.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Optionally, jump a line (or more) and add some text to have also a description of the task.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's all. If you got it until here, you can enjoy this simple way of tracking your time.</p>

<p>Hopefully, more features will come soon.</p>
