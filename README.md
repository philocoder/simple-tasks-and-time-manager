<h1>Simple Tasks and Time Manager</h1>

<h3>A new, minimalist, simple and fashion way of managing your time and set up your own timetable</h3>

<h6>It will be easy, fast, and unpainfull, just give it a chance</h6>

<p>
This is a functional (and random) example of how to use this application:
<pre><b>28/2/2017

10:00-11:00 => Have the deal with that guy.
21:00-21:15 => Meet that girl at the restaurant.

1/3/2017

6:45-7:00 => Pick some trumpets.

</b>
</pre>
</p>

<p>
I won't make you lose your time. Instead, I want you to save it. So, let's explain how it works.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download the "index.html" file.</li>
  <li>Open it with your favourite browser.</li>
  <li>Ready.</li>
  <li>Once there, you have an example, you can follow it, or follow this instructions.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Now that you are ready, you just need to know what to type in the text box.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Start with a day.</p>
    <p>The followed format is: 
      <p><b>{day}/{month}/{year}</b></p>
    </p>
    <p>Some examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>30/1/2017</li>
      <li>30/12/2018</li>
      <li>15/5/2019</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add a new line</li>
  <li>
    <p>Add an hour to start, and hour to finish, and the name of the task</p>
    <p>The followed format is: 
      <p><b>{hours}:{minutes}-{hours}:{minutes} => {task name}</b></p>
    </p>
    <p>Some examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>6:00 => Get up.</li>
      <li>15:00 => Have a "buena siesta".</li>
      <li>18:00 => Have a break.</li>
      <li>22:00 => Go to sleep</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Optionally, you can here add a new line and a description, which must be a text that... just that don't start lines as if you were declaring newly a start-and-end-hours, or a new day, all the rest will be taken as description.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>That's all. If you got it until here, you can enjoy this simple way of tracking your time.</p>

<p>Hopefully, more features will come soon.</p>
